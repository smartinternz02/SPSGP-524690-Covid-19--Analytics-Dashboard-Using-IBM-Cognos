The COVID-19 Analytics Dashboard is a project developed using IBM Cognos, a powerful
business intelligence and analytics platform. The goal of this project is to provide a
comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard that enables users to analyze and
visualize data related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The dashboard integrates various data sources, including official government reports,
public health databases, and other reliable sources, to provide up-to-date and accurate
information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, vaccination progress,
and other relevant metrics. The data is collected, processed, and transformed into
meaningful insights using IBM Cognos' data modeling and analytics capabilities.
The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface with interactive visualizations, charts,
graphs, and maps that allow users to explore the data from different angles and
perspectives. Users can filter the data by geographic location, time periods, demographic
factors, and other variables to gain deeper insights into the impact of COVID-19.
Key features of the COVID-19 Analytics Dashboard may include:
● Real-time data updates: The dashboard fetches the latest data and updates the
visualizations in real-time to provide accurate and current information.
● Interactive visualizations: Users can interact with the visualizations, such as
zooming in on specific regions, selecting data points for detailed information, and
comparing trends over time.
● Geospatial analysis: The dashboard may include maps with color-coded regions to
represent the severity of COVID-19 cases, allowing users to understand the
geographical distribution of the virus.
● Comparative analysis: Users can compare COVID-19 statistics across different
countries, states, or cities to identify variations and trends.
● Predictive modeling: Advanced analytics techniques can be applied to predict
future trends, forecast potential outbreaks, and assess the effectiveness of
containment measures.
● Data drill-down: Users can drill down into specific data points to explore
underlying factors contributing to the spread of the virus, such as age groups,
comorbidities, or vaccination rates.
● The COVID-19 Analytics Dashboard aims to empower decision-makers, public
health officials, researchers, and the general public with valuable insights to better
understand the impact of the pandemic, make informed decisions, and develop
effective strategies for prevention, mitigation, and recovery.
